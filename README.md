This is an interactive program to visualize the A* pathfinding algorithm, A* is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.
This algorithm is guaranteed to give you the shortest path between two points.
Another functionality is the Maze genenration which is an interesting algorithm within itself, it is a recursive algorithm which creates a maze where it is possible to get from any point on the maze to any other point.

# User Guide

There is a drop down menu with the options "End", "Start" ,"Wall", "Erase" as soon as the program recognizes a 'Start' and an 'End' it will immediately try to find the shortest path,the button 'Create Maze' generates a random maze each time, and the button erase resets the screen.
